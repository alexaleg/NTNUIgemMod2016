## Abstract
This task included a formulation of the model by studying the operating principle of the gate. An expected response function was proposed accordingly. The model was solved in both dynamic state and steady state for a range of inputs for an initial set of kinetic parameters. The model was improved by modifying some equilibrium constants in a given range. An improved response surface was obtained as a result.
